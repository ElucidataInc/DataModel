        example: "The identification of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome
            the intrinsic or acquired resistance to trametinib in mutant KRAS lung
            adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a major challenge. This study analyzes the effects
            of trametinib in Id1, a key factor involved in the oncogenic KRAS pathway,
            and investigates the Id1 role in acquire resistance and synergy with immunotherapy
            in KRAS-driven LUAD. Restoring the antitumor immune response by blocking
            programmed-cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed-cell death-ligand
            1 (PD-L1) pathway represents a major breakthrough in non-small-cell lung
            cancer (NSCLC) treatment. Nevertheless, a high proportion of LUAD patients
            with KRAS alterations remain refractory to this therapy. Material and
            Methods: To explore whether MEK1/2 inhibition reduces Id1 expression,
            in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells
            and murine models. RNAseq analysis was performed to elucidate the pathways
            involved in Id1 inhibition. Apoptosis and PD-L1 expression was measured
            by flow cytometry. Synergy of trametinib combined with anti-PD1 was investigated
            in KRAS-mutant LUAD mouse models. Results: Using preclinical syngeneic
            KRAS-mutant lung cancer mouse models, we demonstrate that trametinib synergizes
            with PD-1 blockade to reduce lung cancer progression and increase mice
            overall survival. This antitumor activity was linked to the degradation
            of Id1 via proteasome, and an enhanced INF-Y-mediated PD-L1 tumor cell
            expression in KRAS-mutant tumor cells. This effect required CD8+ T cells,
            boosted the intratumoral CD8+/Treg ratio, reducing the intratumoral Treg/CD4+
            ratio. Conclusions: Our data may support the role of Id1 in the trametinib
            antitumoral effect, sustaining the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK)
            signaling pathway involved in the trametinib acquired resistance cells
            and sensitizing KRAS-mutant lung tumors to PD-1 inhibitors, through PD-L1
            overexpression."
