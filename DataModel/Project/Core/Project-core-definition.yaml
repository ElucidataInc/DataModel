      summary:
        description: Summary of the study which provides information about the key objectives and results from the publication
        type: string
        example: The identification of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome the intrinsic 
            or acquired resistance to trametinib in mutant KRAS lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a major challenge. 
            This study analyzes the effects of trametinib in Id1, a key factor involved in the oncogenic KRAS 
            pathway, and investigates the Id1 role in acquire resistance and synergy with immunotherapy in KRAS-driven 
            LUAD. Restoring the antitumor immune response by blocking programmed-cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and 
            programmed-cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway represents a major breakthrough in non-small-cell lung 
            cancer (NSCLC) treatment. Nevertheless, a high proportion of LUAD patients with KRAS alterations remain 
            refractory to this therapy.

            trametinib-mediated Id1 downregulation, a global transcriptomic profiling
            using RNA sequencing analysis was performed on murine CMT167 and KLA lung
            cancer cells treated or not with trametinib
