        gene_info:

          example: The protein encoded by this gene acts as a homotetramer to catalyze
            diacetyl reductase and L-xylulose reductase reactions. The encoded protein
            may play a role in the uronate cycle of glucose metabolism and in the
            cellular osmoregulation in the proximal renal tubules. Defects in this
            gene are a cause of pentosuria. Two transcript variants encoding different
            isoforms have been found for this gene.[provided by RefSeq, Aug 2010]
