      example: "Background: The identification of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance
        to overcome resistance to the MEK inhibitor trametinib in mutant KRAS
        lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a challenge. This study analyzes the effects
        of trametinib on Id1 protein, a key factor involved in the KRAS oncogenic
        pathway, and investigates the role of Id1 in the acquired resistance to
        trametinib as well as the synergistic anticancer effect of trametinib 
        combined with immunotherapy in KRAS-mutant LUAD. Methods: We evaluated
        the effects of trametinib on KRAS-mutant LUAD by Western blot, RNA-seq
        and different syngeneic mouse models. Genetic modulation of Id1 expression
        was performed in KRAS-mutant LUAD cells by lentiviral or retroviral transductions
        of specific vectors. Cell viability was assessed by cell proliferation
        and colony formation assays. PD-L1 expression and apoptosis were measured
        by flow cytometry. The anti-tumor efficacy of the combined treatment with
        trametinib and PD-1 blockade was investigated in KRAS-mutant LUAD mouse
        models, and the effects on the tumor immune infiltrate were analyzed by
        flow cytometry and immunohistochemistry. Results: We found that trametinib
        activates the proteasome-ubiquitin system to downregulate Id1 in KRAS-mutant
        LUAD tumors. Moreover, we found that Id1 plays a major role in the acquired
        resistance to trametinib treatment in KRAS-mutant LUAD cells. Using two
        preclinical syngeneic KRAS-mutant LUAD mouse models, we found that trametinib
        synergizes with PD-1/PD-L1 blockade to hamper lung cancer progression
        and increase survival. This anti-tumor activity depended on trametinib-mediated
        Id1 reduction and was associated with a less immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment
        and increased PD-L1 expression on tumor cells.Conclusions: Our data demonstrate
        that Id1 expression is involved in the resistance to trametinib and in
        the synergistic effect of trametinib with anti-PD-1 therapy in KRAS-mutant
        LUAD tumors. These findings suggest a potential therapeutic approach for
        immunotherapy-refractory KRAS-mutant lung cancers."
