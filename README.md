# Polly Data Model
Boilerplate for a unified biological data model for biomedical molecular data on Polly. 

Data Models play a crucial role because they define the harmonised representation formats and semantics that will be used by applications both to consume and to manage data.

This repository contains the data model defined in a json format that stores each biological entity alongwith relevant attributes that are contained within. Each entity is accompanied by examples data that can be stored using this data structure.  

**This repository only accepts changes through pull requests that will be reviewed by a team responsible for maintaining the data model.**
